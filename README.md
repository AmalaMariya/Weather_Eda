# Weather_Eda

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on weather data. The aim is to extract meaningful insights and visualizations that reveal trends, patterns, and anomalies in the data.

## Project Overview

In this project, we analyze a weather dataset to answer data-driven questions, such as:

- What are the patterns of temperature change over time?
- How does humidity vary with temperature?
- Which month has the highest precipitation on average?

## Features

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Data Visualization (using pie charts, bar plots, etc.)
- Statistical Analysis of Key Weather Parameters

## Tools and Libraries

- Python: The primary programming language.
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- matplotlib: For data visualization.
- seaborn: For enhanced visualizations.
